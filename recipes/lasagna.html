    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Do you enjoy a delicious lasagna? Who am I kidding, who doesn't!</p>
    <p>I've scoured the web in search for a quick, easy and above all, tasty lasagna recipe
        and I've found one you and the entire family will love!</p>
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Bulk Italian sausage or ground beef</li>
        <li>Ricotta, Mozzarella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Remove the lasagna noodles from heat after 4 minutes. They will continue to cook as they bake. This way, the noodles will be perfectly al dente.</li>
        <li>To stop the noodles from further cooking, transfer them into a colander and run them under cold water. </li>
        <li>Stop the noodles from sticking together by laying them in a single layer on a piece of parchment paper brushed with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Here’s an alternative “cooking” method: soak the noodles in hot water for 30 minutes. They’ll be soft enough by then. </li>
        <li>Shred your own mozzarella for maximum melting potential.</li>
        <li>Use freshly grated parmesan cheese for optimum flavor. You want to use real parmesan, too, not the one from a can.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with marinara sauce before adding the lasagne noodles. Otherwise, the noodles will stick to the pan, and it will be tough to take them out when slicing. Be sure the bottom of the pan is well-coated!</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before you slice and serve. If you slice it straight from the oven, the layers will slide apart as you cut. Give it time to set!</li>
        <li>Use a chef’s knife to slice the lasagna into squares. Use a flexible spatula to transfer it from the pan to the plate. </li>
        <li>To reheat leftover lasagna, cover the pan with foil and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>To freeze leftover lasagna, wrap the pan in plastic wrap twice and once in foil. Transfer it to the fridge a day before use. Reheat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Frozen lasagna lasts for up to 2-3 months</li>
